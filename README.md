# Summary #

Two Additional Visualizations that would have been very helpful for this analysis would be comparison of the number of people in NY v the number of people that live in the radius of the citi bike stations. As this would guage interest, this could be a useful figure to have. 

Another good visualization would be the trip area in the form of a map. This would show if people are riding around sight seeing and what kinds of sights? Are there similar sights in Des Moines?
